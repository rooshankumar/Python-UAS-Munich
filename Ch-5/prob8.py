# # if languages of 2 friends are same then?

# Dictionary keys are unique, but values can be repeated.

# This means two friends can have the same language, and it will not cause any problem.

# Only keys (friend names) must be unique; values (languages) can repeat.

# Enter friend 1's name: Roshan
# Enter Roshan's favorite language: Python
# Enter friend 2's name: Priya
# Enter Priya's favorite language: Python
# Enter friend 3's name: Amit
# Enter Amit's favorite language: Java
# Enter friend 4's name: Roshan
# Enter Roshan's favorite language: C++
# Enter friend 5's name: Neha
# Enter Neha's favorite language: Java

# Friends and their favorite languages:
# Roshan: ['Python', 'C++']
# Priya: ['Python']
# Amit: ['Java']
# Neha: ['Java']


# Explanation:

# Roshan entered Python first, then C++ — stored as ['Python', 'C++'].

# Priya entered Python — stored as ['Python'].

# Notice how Python is repeated as a value for different friends. This is allowed because values can repeat.

# Only keys (friend names) need to be unique.
